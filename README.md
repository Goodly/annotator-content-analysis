# annotator-content-analysis
An annotation interface for detailed text annotation by crowdworkers along researcher-defined topics of interest.

Built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux).

####To setup

From the project directory, run

```
npm install
bower install
```


You might also want to install Devtools for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/09/02/new-react-developer-tools.html). For Redux, you can install the [Google Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd) or use the other methods described in at the bottom of [this page](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) in the README.

####To develop

Run `npm run dev` from the project dir to build and serve the development app.

####To deploy

Run `npm run deploy` and the output files will be written to the `dist` folder.

NOTE: this command currently is not fully functional and most likely will not work. Running `npm run dev` instead will show the most recent version of the code.
